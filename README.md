# Contactless-Payments-Website-Project

Jeff Cao OPIM 668 Website Project

This website's primary objective is to introduce contactless payment technologies such as NFC, QR codes, and digital wallets. I hope you enjoy learning more about each of these contactless solutions through the website's creative and interactive features.

Full transparency, this website and the corresponding stylesheet was NOT coded originally or entirely by Jeff Cao. The original template was downloaded from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency, and Jeff has repurposed it as much as possible for the purposes of this class project submission. This includes several updates to the website layout, style, pictures, features, and text. In addition, the website text was compiled from consulting several public articles, which are listed in the "Credits" tab. 

Please reach out to Jeff at jc3219@georgetown.edu with any questions, comments, concerns, or if you'd like to chat more about FinTech.
Thank you.
